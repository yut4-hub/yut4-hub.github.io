        <title>Langsam Beeilen</title>
        <link rel="alternate" href="http://example.com/2024/08/29/beeilen/"/>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; The title is a German slang, which means “slowly hurry&amp;#x2F;go”. I learned this slang from a German friend, Franz, during volunteering. I really love this slang. People always expect preparing everything before conducting a plan, while it will never be perfect, which will slow down your pace to move on. “Slowly hurry&amp;#x2F;go” depicts a status of moving on a little bit without perfect preparation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Similarly, my travel is not perfectly prepared, but once I put myself on the way traveling, I knew I made it. My first stop was Atlanta and Miami. Carrying on over 60lb bagages, I flew from Chicago to Atlanta to visit uncle Frank who was my dad’s classmate living in Atlanta. I stayed at his home for a week. We went fishing, worked out, and shot guns. Everything I experienced there was so American style. That was my first fishing experience. The fish guide detected groups of fish by rada and sonar. We finally got more than ten weevers. They are kind of delicious but not easy to cook. The last but not the least, we enjoyed Chinese food! It was hard to express how much I missed those food. While, time flew quickly, and I went to Miami to catch my flight. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; In Miami, I met my friends and traveled around as well. One of my best friend, Cong, came from Boston to farewell. She brought me some stuff that I would use during my travel. Also, she was a lecturer in MIT. I really respected her a lot, and we also discussed some details of writing an academic paper. Sure! I did some academic research while traveling. Another friend was a classmate working in a landscape architecture corp. He complained a lot to me about his boss and his working schedule, over ten hours a day! I had to say international students sometimes were disadvantaged group in the labor market. I also met a family from Britain, my host family. The host was Canadian, and his wife was Cuban. They had a son named Lin. Interestingly, Lin is a typical Chinese last name. The hostess told me she loved Chinese name. When I told her my next spot was Cuba. She was superised and made some phone call to her family in Cuba to inform me the latest condition in Cuba. She said it was not perfect to travel at that moment because of poor economy. I was scared a little bit but still wanted to observe by myself. So, I shared my number with her and updated my travel then. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; On July 28th, 2023, I left for Cuba, a mysterious country in my “world”.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>New Advanture</title>
        <link rel="alternate" href="http://example.com/2024/08/15/Advanture/"/>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; “Travel around the world” is the most romantic experience that I could imagine in my life. It’s been a while since I completed my world travel in 2023. Whenever I recall this amazing experience, I always feel excited and unforgetable. Now, I think it is a good point to record my experience as my memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Exploration has been the rhythm of my life since I was a kid. My home was moved to different places for multiple times, which enforced me to get familiar with new environment frequently. From a countryside to a small town, from the City of Harbin to Shanghai, a new environment broaden my view and reconstructed my attitude of life. Interestingly, I was a timid boy before middle school. It’s funny to recall my childhood that I could barely go to a library alone which was only 2 kilometer away from my home. To be brave enough, I always went to school as a group with my best friends. I guess that might be caused by frequent changes of living environment. I got easily surprised at unfamiliar stuff. Meanwhile, even if I was too timid to travel alone, I tried my best to hang out with my friends and my family at different places. A huge change happened when I completed my primary school in Harbin. My family moved to Shanghai, an international mega city, not similar with Harbin anymore. The living environment changed again, but this time was a little different. Summer is hotter with higher humity in Shanghai, and people’s accent is different. My old friends were 2,000 kilometers away from me. I had to make new friends, learn new accent, and get used to a more complex environment than before. Fortunately, I enjoyed this change. My parents were busy with work, and I made new friends alone. Also, I got brave enough to travel by myself. Sometimes, I could get some budget from parents to support my trips. My home was moved twice more inside the city until I finished my high school in 2015. I went college in Beijing. Actually, I did not apply any colleges in Shanghai because this time I wanted to explore “ouside” alone. I was not static during undergraduate, and I traveled to most provinces in China. I also learned a lot outside textbook, from travel and work in the Red Cross. Then, I applied UIUC for my Masters’ Degrees. In terms of my expertise, I broaded my knowledge from civil engineering to urban plannning to geography. I enjoyed merging my knowledge and utilized my advange to guide new field, such as use data analysis in policy and decision making. When completed my degrees. I enrolled in a post-graduate program, which allowed me to work in the government of Illinois, and make enough money for travelling. At the age of 25, I got a perfect condition with good “health”, flexable “schedule”, and enough “budget”. Even I could have applied a higher-salary job, but I still decided to explore the world first and learn from the “outside”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; On July 18th, as the horn of Amtrak coming close to me at Springfield train station, I carried on my bags and started my expected new advanture of my life.&lt;/p&gt;
