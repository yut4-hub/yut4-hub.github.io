        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; When I traveled, I collected brace lace for each country. Totally, I visited ten countries and collected ten brace laces. Among all of them, I preferred the one I bought in Peru most. Outside a small store along the street in Cusco, a brace lace with some geometric shapes, continuous triangles, attracted my attention. The sailor told me that means showing respect to mountains. As for a country like Peru, mountains could be found here and there. I believed in that ancestors of Peruvian must appreciated mountains for settlement and fear the disaster caused by them. As for me, I enjoyed traveling inside mountains and visiting mountainous spots, but slightly feared altitude sick.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Leaving for Peru, I was excited again, for it was my first time in the south earth. It would be fun to obtain whirlpool becomes clockwise. Once I landed in Lima, I visited museums to learn its history. Larco Museum was one of my favorites, which demonstrated the whole Peruvian history and culture. Marvelous artworks from different periods made me feel like time traveling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &lt;em&gt;Machu Pichu: Seven Wonders in the new world&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Our world is so mysterious that we cannot understand the basic rule as individuals. For me, I would like to feel it by observing and touching. It was just like my way to Machu Pichu. I have to say it was my love! From Lima, I took a fly to Cusco, a small town close to Machu Pichu. Every tourist had to passed by to visit this marvelous spot. I spent a few days in Cusco to get familiar with high altitude. Then, I took a bus to hot water town, which included 7-hour mountainous road trip and 3-hour hiking along tracks. That was exhausting without doubt. Fortunately, I made a lot of friends on the bus. They were all young people of my age from different countries, such as Argentina, Chile, Brazil and Israel. Thanks for them, my trip was not that tough. Although my legs and feet could hardly move, I still expected to Machu Pichu greatly. On the second day, I finally observed this wonder! Buildings (structures actually) stood on the top of mountains. I could not imagine how people from Inka Empire built them how they moved some many big stones from bottom to peaks. I also made a friend in Machu Pichu. She is Chinese working in Colombia, and she had traveled alone to most Latin America. At the end of my visit, some Peruvian kids asked me to take a photo together. I was happy not only because they asked for taking photos together, but also because I was at an opposite position. When I was young in China, kids were surprised at foreigners, and some may want to take a picture with them. Now, I became a foreigner for them. Another memorable story in Machu Pichu was on the ancient Inka Road. I met a group of old tourists lining up in a row from my opposite direction. I greeted to them and clapped hands with them one by one just like an athlete! I regrated not recording it, but the scene would always stay in my memory!&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;/../img/12.JPG&#34; alt=&#34;image&#34;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;img/12.JPG&#34; alt=&#34;drawing&#34; width=&#34;200&#34;/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Cuban travel left me with remarkable memory, attractive nature touched me greatly. I was sure that I would be back there sooner or later. That will be interesting to observe differences years later. Then, I headed for my next spot, Colombia. Seven days in Colombia was not a long trip, but that did not mean a boring experience. Hispanic culture and their history are way different from the others. No doubt, Marquez named ‚ÄúA hundred years of Solitude‚Äù.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &lt;em&gt;Bogota: Potential danger&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Staying at small town in the States for a long time, I had to say skyscrapers were unfamiliar for me. Bogota was similar with other cities which are segregated greatly. The north district is safe, but the south is not. I spent a whole day walking around the city, from my hotel to different museums. I planned four days here with three museum visits which were the national museum, gold museum, and Botero museum. The national museum shows its history and how Colombian people united. I love history, but South American history was blank in my mind. It was interesting that Colombian history was so isolated. There were a lot of Inka Empire, only a period of colonization by Spain. Therefore, the national museum was kind of boring because it just explained where Colombia was from, and how people united. The second museum, Gold Museum, was more interesting. It showed how people used gold to decorate and how jewelry designed and made. However, an earthquake interrupted my plan. I did not finish this museum tour, and Botero museum neither. That was my first earthquake experience. Nearly 6.0 magnitude made the whole building shake strongly. At the first few seconds, I was confused slightly, for I had no sense of earthquake. Then, I was aware that the earthquake happened, and I moved to the corner for safety. However, I did not leave the museum directly and expected to resume my visit shortly. Staff asked me to leave because the museum would be closed. While, due to the earthquake, I made a friend who were next to me during the earthquake. Since, my visit was interrupted, I bought her a coffee and wandered around the city for a while. She was supposed to take a bus to her home at night, but the bus was not on service. On the next day, I climbed to a mountain where I got a bird view of the city, big but polluted. The temperature was comfortable, or even slightly chilly. The whole city is surrounded by mountains. In the afternoon, I walked around the city with my new friend, where we found Marquez Plaza, a music show by university, and a party to celebrate the establishment of Bogota for 500 years. At night, Bogota was a little bit dangerous. Pedestrians told me not take my phone outside my pocket due to theft. There were some drug activities at night, so it was even hard for me to take an Uber. Especially for the south district, drivers would not access there. Somehow, I was shocked by it.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &lt;em&gt;Medellin: Drug history&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Four days were short for visiting a city. I moved my feet to visit another one, Medellin. It was famous for its drug history and its cable transportation. As an urban planner, Medellin is famous, which is a good example of transportation plan. People in slums spread across mountains, so it used to be difficult for them to access to resources like education, transportation, or even healthcare. Therefore, cable cars connect people in slum with city.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Before I went to Medellin, I did some research. I discovered the wealthy districts where they have lower crime cases. When I landed, I found the city was poorer than Bogota, but as the uber driving, the city became beautiful and clean, a totally different environment. Near my hotel, I found a Korean restaurant. The boss was graduated from UIUC as well, and surprisingly he could even spoke Chinese. On the next day, I visited Comuna 13, which is the most famous slum. It was totally different though. People were doing business along the street, and it was extremely crowded. Dance and music were everywhere. They had a lot of street painting on the wall where you can obtain small holes by bullets. That district used to be the base of gangsters and criminals. Children over 15 were forced to transport drugs for them, and they shot guns almost every day. As a guy without any memory of chaos, that was horrible and hard to imagine how people struggled for living. During my stay, I joined a city walk. My tour guide shared his experience. When he was young, he had to hide behind walls on his way to school, and his sister was murdered by criminals. There were a lot of crimes, and people suffered from drugs. During city walk, I observed a man and a woman taking a drug in front of me, a theft stealing a phone, and a girl lying on the chair with an extremely weird pose.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Overall, Colombia is a complicated country. Its history was full of pain, colonization and drug, but they have kind people and comfortable environment.&lt;/p&gt;

        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; If you ask me to recommend only one place for traveling, Cuba will be my answer for sure! For me, it left me with impressive and unreplaceable memory. From general perspective, as a county of total Socialism, life in Cuba seems as mysterious as North Korea, apart from the enthusiastic vibe and impressive beaches and forests. One thing to complain will be its high temperature all year round. There are three things to represent Cuba, which are mojito, cigar and salsa. Drink a shot of mojito, take a cigar, and dance a salsa. What a life!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; As a Chinese guy, I am familiar with Socialism for sure. But as I grew up, my society has been reformed already since the 1980s. As a Gen Z, marketing in China has not been restricted any more. We called ‚Äútwo hands‚Äù controlling the economy, the government and market. From my view, it is kind of similar with the New Deal by Roosevelt. Government places an important role in promoting big programs such as transportation engineering, and lets the market optimize the economy, but this process is detected by government for macro-control. However, Cuba is different because it is more like Chine without economy reform. I was curious about people‚Äôs life there, especially in post-pandemic era. Also, the history and its culture were attractive for me.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; The following was the notes I took during travel:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &lt;strong&gt;On the Beautiful Aspects of Cuba‚Äôs Everyday Life&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; As a tourist staying in Cuba for three weeks, the impression Cuba left on me was one of passionate music, modest satisfaction, and a leisurely lifestyle.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; In every city and corner, music is always the way the Cuban people express their love for life. The central square of a city is a hub of entertainment. When the temperature drops, children and adults gather there to sing, dance, or talk about their day. What impressed me the most was a restaurant in Santa Clara, where guests enthusiastically joined in the singing performances, and music and performances were organized on the street. People, free from the constraints of electronic devices, embraced real life through music.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; At the same time, life is also about appropriate contentment. The government provides each person with one jin (half a kilogram) of rice, one jin of meat, and six jin of beans (depending on the city) per month. The rest of the food and fruit is bought at the market. Medical care is free. It seems that people do not exhaust themselves trying to earn money and do not lose their lives for the sake of money; they appear to be content with what they have. And what about our lives? Who hasn‚Äôt fantasized about retiring at 35 to enjoy life, but at 35, we find ourselves trapped in the high walls of the houses, cars, and vacations we‚Äôve built.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Lastly, life here seems to slow down a beat. The sight of cars from the sixties makes you feel like you‚Äôve stepped into a movie. People stroll leisurely on the streets, and even the cats and dogs lazily lie on the ground. All memories of time seem to have stopped. Combined with the scorching temperatures all year round, it feels as if people have forgotten what day it is; today is no different from yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &lt;strong&gt;On the Reality Behind Cuba‚Äôs Beauty&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; As a solo backpacker, the fun lies in communicating with people, chatting with guesthouse owners in different cities, fellow travelers, or local street dwellers. The last article recorded the beauty of Cuba; this one will one-sidedly document the reality of Cuban life as I understand it.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; As a socialist country, market economy struggles in Cuba. But what if the government doesn‚Äôt have job opportunities? Imagine being laid off in the 90s without being able to engage in private business; that‚Äôs the current situation in Cuba. In Cuba, you‚Äôll find that although it is surrounded by the sea, no one fishes. Why? Because it‚Äôs illegal! Ordinary people have little chance to fish. Similarly, other private businesses are illegal without a permit (which comes with at least a two-year sentence if caught). And how do you get a permit? With dollars or euros! That‚Äôs why people exchange money on the black market, but the exchange rates fluctuate terrifyingly (from 150 pesos for 1 dollar in March to 250 pesos in August). So, what do you do if you have no money and no job? Street business on the black market becomes their last means of survival.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; What about wages in Cuba? The minimum government salary is 2,000 pesos, 8,000 pesos for nurses, and 10,000 pesos for police officers. These figures might seem abstract, so let me give you an example: in Havana, I could spend over 2,000 pesos on just one meal; a liter of milk costs 2,000 pesos. Milk has become a luxury here.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; And what about leaving Cuba? It‚Äôs extremely difficult. The costs of passports, visas, and other paperwork are prohibitively high, and only a few families can afford to send their children abroad. Still, nearly a million young people left Cuba last year, some of whom took dangerous routes (tb). Some rowed small boats to Florida, and others trekked across the deserts of Mexico. But, of course, a big wave or a desert storm could result in eternal sleep.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; In Cuba, cities may be the worst places, as Mr. Wen Tiejun said, city dwellers have lost the backing of the land. A Vietnamese friend who visited Cuba ten years ago told me that Havana is sinking into poverty, with shortages of energy, food, water, clothes, and medical resources. Villagers and small-town residents might be happier because they can be self-sufficient in food and find spiritual satisfaction in tobacco, alcohol, and music.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; What I remember most is a conversation with an unemployed uncle on the streets of Havana. A few months ago, his factory closed, leaving him without any income. His skin sagged from rapid weight loss, yet he still had two children to support. He spoke admiringly of China‚Äôs ability to build a makeshift hospital in two weeks. I was about to say that this was achieved through people‚Äôs around-the-clock overtime, while young people would rather have a nine-to-five job. But seeing the look in his eyes, I swallowed my words. Perhaps, for him, having a job is a great blessing, while we might be pursuing different goals. We talked for an afternoon; he choked up, and I was helpless. In the end, I gave him 1,000 pesos and bought his story.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; So, is this seemingly leisurely life what we are after? As a traveler, I still love Cuba, with its easy-going life, warm people, and time standing still, but maybe only on the level of a travel experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

        <title>üá∫üá∏ Langsam Beeilen</title>

        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; The title is a German slang, which means ‚Äúslowly hurry&amp;#x2F;go‚Äù. I learned this slang from a German friend, Franz, during volunteering. I really love this slang. People always expect preparing everything before conducting a plan, while it will never be perfect, which will slow down your pace to move on. ‚ÄúSlowly hurry&amp;#x2F;go‚Äù depicts a status of moving on a little bit without perfect preparation.&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Similarly, my travel is not perfectly prepared, but once I put myself on the way traveling, I knew I made it. My first stop was Atlanta and Miami. Carrying on over 60lb bagages, I flew from Chicago to Atlanta to visit uncle Frank who was my dad‚Äôs classmate living in Atlanta. I stayed at his home for a week. We went fishing, worked out, and shot guns. Everything I experienced there was so American style. That was my first fishing experience. The fish guide detected groups of fish by rada and sonar. We finally got more than ten weevers. They are kind of delicious but not easy to cook. The last but not the least, we enjoyed Chinese food! It was hard to express how much I missed those food. While, time flew quickly, and I went to Miami to catch my flight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; In Miami, I met my friends and traveled around as well. One of my best friend, Cong, came from Boston to farewell. She brought me some stuff that I would use during my travel. Also, she was a lecturer in MIT. I really respected her a lot, and we also discussed some details of writing an academic paper. Sure! I did some academic research while traveling. Another friend was a classmate working in a landscape architecture corp. He complained a lot to me about his boss and his working schedule, over ten hours a day! I had to say international students sometimes were disadvantaged group in the labor market. I also met a family from Britain, my host family. The host was Canadian, and his wife was Cuban. They had a son named Lin. Interestingly, Lin is a typical Chinese last name. The hostess told me she loved Chinese name. When I told her my next spot was Cuba. She was superised and made some phone call to her family in Cuba to inform me the latest condition in Cuba. She said it was not perfect to travel at that moment because of poor economy. I was scared a little bit but still wanted to observe by myself. So, I shared my number with her and updated my travel then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; On July 28th, 2023, I left for Cuba, a mysterious country in my ‚Äúworld‚Äù.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>üåç New Advanture</title>
        <link rel="alternate" href="http://example.com/2024/08/15/Advanture/"/>
        <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; ‚ÄúTravel around the world‚Äù is the most romantic experience that I could imagine in my life. It‚Äôs been a while since I completed my world travel in 2023. Whenever I recall this amazing experience, I always feel excited and unforgetable. Now, I think it is a good point to record my experience as my memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Exploration has been the rhythm of my life since I was a kid. My home was moved to different places for multiple times, which enforced me to get familiar with new environment frequently. From a countryside to a small town, from the City of Harbin to Shanghai, a new environment broaden my view and reconstructed my attitude of life. Interestingly, I was a timid boy before middle school. It‚Äôs funny to recall my childhood that I could barely go to a library alone which was only 2 kilometer away from my home. To be brave enough, I always went to school as a group with my best friends. I guess that might be caused by frequent changes of living environment. I got easily surprised at unfamiliar stuff. Meanwhile, even if I was too timid to travel alone, I tried my best to hang out with my friends and my family at different places. A huge change happened when I completed my primary school in Harbin. My family moved to Shanghai, an international mega city, not similar with Harbin anymore. The living environment changed again, but this time was a little different. Summer is hotter with higher humity in Shanghai, and people‚Äôs accent is different. My old friends were 2,000 kilometers away from me. I had to make new friends, learn new accent, and get used to a more complex environment than before. Fortunately, I enjoyed this change. My parents were busy with work, and I made new friends alone. Also, I got brave enough to travel by myself. Sometimes, I could get some budget from parents to support my trips. My home was moved twice more inside the city until I finished my high school in 2015. I went college in Beijing. Actually, I did not apply any colleges in Shanghai because this time I wanted to explore ‚Äúouside‚Äù alone. I was not static during undergraduate, and I traveled to most provinces in China. I also learned a lot outside textbook, from travel and work in the Red Cross. Then, I applied UIUC for my Masters‚Äô Degrees. In terms of my expertise, I broaded my knowledge from civil engineering to urban plannning to geography. I enjoyed merging my knowledge and utilized my advange to guide new field, such as use data analysis in policy and decision making. When completed my degrees. I enrolled in a post-graduate program, which allowed me to work in the government of Illinois, and make enough money for travelling. At the age of 25, I got a perfect condition with good ‚Äúhealth‚Äù, flexable ‚Äúschedule‚Äù, and enough ‚Äúbudget‚Äù. Even I could have applied a higher-salary job, but I still decided to explore the world first and learn from the ‚Äúoutside‚Äù.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; On July 18th, as the horn of Amtrak coming close to me at Springfield train station, I carried on my bags and started my expected new advanture of my life.&lt;/p&gt;
