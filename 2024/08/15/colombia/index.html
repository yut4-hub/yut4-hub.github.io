I’m certain I’ll return one day, and it will be fascinating to observe the changes over time. After Cuba, my next destination was Colombia. Though my seven days there weren’t long, they were packed with excitement. The vibrant Hispanic culture and rich history are unlike any other. It’s no wonder Gabriel García Márquez wrote <em>One Hundred Years of Solitude</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Bogota: Potential Danger</strong></p>
<p>Having lived in small towns in the U.S. for quite some time, the sight of skyscrapers felt unfamiliar to me. Bogota, like many other major cities, is deeply divided—while the northern district is relatively safe, the south is known for its dangers. I spent an entire day walking around the city, visiting various museums. I planned to stay in Bogota for four days, with visits to the National Museum, the Gold Museum, and the Botero Museum.</p>
<p>The National Museum covered Colombian history and the unity of its people. I’ve always been fascinated by history, but I knew little about South American history, so this visit filled some gaps. Colombian history is quite isolated, with a lot of focus on the Inca Empire and a period of Spanish colonization, but not much else. I found the museum a bit dull as it mostly explained how Colombia came to be and how its people united.</p>
<p>The Gold Museum, however, was much more intriguing, showcasing how gold was used for decoration and jewelry-making. Unfortunately, an earthquake interrupted my visit. It was my first earthquake experience—a 6.0 magnitude quake shook the building. At first, I was slightly confused, having never experienced an earthquake before, but I quickly realized what was happening and moved to a safe corner. I didn’t leave the museum right away, thinking the visit would soon resume, but the staff asked everyone to evacuate, as the museum was closing.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the earthquake led to me making a new friend—she was standing next to me when it happened. Since my museum tour was cut short, I bought her a coffee, and we spent the afternoon exploring the city together. She was supposed to take a bus home that night, but the service had been canceled due to the earthquake.</p>
<p>The following day, I hiked up to a mountain viewpoint overlooking Bogota. The city is large but heavily polluted. Despite that, the weather was pleasant, even slightly chilly. In the afternoon, my new friend and I continued to explore the city, discovering Márquez Plaza, a music performance by university students, and a celebration for Bogota’s 500th anniversary.</p>
<p>At night, however, Bogota felt dangerous. People warned me not to take my phone out of my pocket due to the risk of theft. Drug activity increased after dark, making it difficult to even catch an Uber. In fact, drivers refused to go to the southern district. I found the situation shocking.</p>
<p><strong>Medellin: A City with a Drug-Fueled Past</strong></p>
<p>After four days in Bogota, I set off for my next destination—Medellin. Known for its drug history and innovative cable transportation system, Medellin is also famous among urban planners like me. The city’s cable cars connect slum communities on the surrounding mountains to the urban center, making resources like education, transportation, and healthcare more accessible.</p>
<p>Before arriving, I researched the safer, wealthier areas of the city with lower crime rates. When I landed, Medellin initially seemed poorer than Bogota, but as the Uber drove deeper into the city, I saw beautiful, clean neighborhoods that felt completely different. Near my hotel, I discovered a Korean restaurant owned by a fellow UIUC graduate who surprisingly also spoke Chinese.</p>
<p>The next day, I visited Comuna 13, Medellin’s most famous slum. It wasn’t at all what I expected. The streets were filled with people doing business, and it was incredibly lively. Music and dancing were everywhere. The walls were covered in vibrant street art, some of which had small bullet holes—a haunting reminder of the slum’s violent past. This area was once a base for gangs and criminals, where children as young as 15 were forced to transport drugs, and gunfire was a daily occurrence.</p>
<p>As someone who has never experienced such chaos, it was difficult to comprehend how people survived in those conditions. During my stay, I joined a city walk led by a tour guide who shared his personal experiences. As a child, he had to hide behind walls on his way to school, and his sister was murdered by criminals. Crime was rampant, and drugs tore families apart. On that walk, I witnessed a man and a woman openly taking drugs, a thief stealing a phone, and a girl lying on a bench in a strange, drug-induced state.</p>
<p>Overall, Colombia is a complex country. Its history is marked by pain—colonization and drug-related violence—but it’s also home to warm, kind people and beautiful, diverse landscapes.</p>
