I was sure that I would be back there sooner or later. That will be interesting to observe differences years later. Then, I headed for my next spot, Colombia. Seven days in Colombia was not a long trip, but that did not mean a boring experience. Hispanic culture and their history are way different from the others. No doubt, Marquez named “A hundred years of Solitude”.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <em>Bogota: Potential danger</em><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Staying at small town in the States for a long time, I had to say skyscrapers were unfamiliar for me. Bogota was similar with other cities which are segregated greatly. The north district is safe, but the south is not. I spent a whole day walking around the city, from my hotel to different museums. I planned four days here with three museum visits which were the national museum, gold museum, and Botero museum. The national museum shows its history and how Colombian people united. I love history, but South American history was blank in my mind. It was interesting that Colombian history was so isolated. There were a lot of Inka Empire, only a period of colonization by Spain. Therefore, the national museum was kind of boring because it just explained where Colombia was from, and how people united. The second museum, Gold Museum, was more interesting. It showed how people used gold to decorate and how jewelry designed and made. However, an earthquake interrupted my plan. I did not finish this museum tour, and Botero museum neither. That was my first earthquake experience. Nearly 6.0 magnitude made the whole building shake strongly. At the first few seconds, I was confused slightly, for I had no sense of earthquake. Then, I was aware that the earthquake happened, and I moved to the corner for safety. However, I did not leave the museum directly and expected to resume my visit shortly. Staff asked me to leave because the museum would be closed. While, due to the earthquake, I made a friend who were next to me during the earthquake. Since, my visit was interrupted, I bought her a coffee and wandered around the city for a while. She was supposed to take a bus to her home at night, but the bus was not on service. On the next day, I climbed to a mountain where I got a bird view of the city, big but polluted. The temperature was comfortable, or even slightly chilly. The whole city is surrounded by mountains. In the afternoon, I walked around the city with my new friend, where we found Marquez Plaza, a music show by university, and a party to celebrate the establishment of Bogota for 500 years. At night, Bogota was a little bit dangerous. Pedestrians told me not take my phone outside my pocket due to theft. There were some drug activities at night, so it was even hard for me to take an Uber. Especially for the south district, drivers would not access there. Somehow, I was shocked by it.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <em>Medellin: Drug history</em><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Four days were short for visiting a city. I moved my feet to visit another one, Medellin. It was famous for its drug history and its cable transportation. As an urban planner, Medellin is famous, which is a good example of transportation plan. People in slums spread across mountains, so it used to be difficult for them to access to resources like education, transportation, or even healthcare. Therefore, cable cars connect people in slum with city.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Before I went to Medellin, I did some research. I discovered the wealthy districts where they have lower crime cases. When I landed, I found the city was poorer than Bogota, but as the uber driving, the city became beautiful and clean, a totally different environment. Near my hotel, I found a Korean restaurant. The boss was graduated from UIUC as well, and surprisingly he could even spoke Chinese. On the next day, I visited Comuna 13, which is the most famous slum. It was totally different though. People were doing business along the street, and it was extremely crowded. Dance and music were everywhere. They had a lot of street painting on the wall where you can obtain small holes by bullets. That district used to be the base of gangsters and criminals. Children over 15 were forced to transport drugs for them, and they shot guns almost every day. As a guy without any memory of chaos, that was horrible and hard to imagine how people struggled for living. During my stay, I joined a city walk. My tour guide shared his experience. When he was young, he had to hide behind walls on his way to school, and his sister was murdered by criminals. There were a lot of crimes, and people suffered from drugs. During city walk, I observed a man and a woman taking a drug in front of me, a theft stealing a phone, and a girl lying on the chair with an extremely weird pose.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Overall, Colombia is a complicated country. Its history was full of pain, colonization and drug, but they have kind people and comfortable environment.</p>
