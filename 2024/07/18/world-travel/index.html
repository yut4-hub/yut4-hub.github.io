<p>“Traveling around the world” is the most romantic experience I can imagine in my life. It’s been some time since I completed my world tour in 2023, but whenever I look back on that incredible journey, I still feel the same excitement and sense of wonder. The experience remains unforgettable. My skin became sun-kissed, and my spirit was deeply enriched. Now, I think it’s the perfect moment to document this journey as a cherished memory.</p>

<p>Exploration has been the rhythm of my life since childhood. My family moved frequently, which forced me to adapt to new environments often. From a countryside village to a small town, from Harbin to Shanghai, each new place broadened my perspective and reshaped my attitude toward life.</p>
<p>Interestingly, I was a timid boy before middle school. It’s amusing to look back and remember that I was too scared to visit a library just 2 kilometers from my home. To feel safe, I always walked to school in a group with my best friends. I think this fear may have been caused by the constant changes in my living environment. New places and unfamiliar situations easily overwhelmed me. Despite my shyness, I did my best to venture out with family and friends. A significant change occurred when I completed primary school in Harbin and my family moved to Shanghai, a sprawling international city that was very different from Harbin. The environment shifted again, but this time it felt more challenging. Summers in Shanghai were hotter and more humid, and the local accent was unfamiliar. My old friends were now 2,000 kilometers away, and I had to make new friends, learn the local dialect, and navigate a more complex city. Fortunately, I embraced this change. My parents were busy with work, so I made new friends on my own and eventually gained the courage to travel by myself. Sometimes, I even received a bit of money from my parents to fund my trips. Our family moved twice more within Shanghai, and by the time I graduated high school in 2015, I was ready for my next adventure: college in Beijing. I chose not to apply to universities in Shanghai because I wanted to explore life “outside” on my own terms. During my undergraduate years, I traveled to most provinces in China, gaining invaluable life lessons beyond the textbooks. I also worked with the Red Cross, which further expanded my learning.</p>
<p>Later, I pursued a Master’s degree at UIUC, expanding my expertise from civil engineering to urban planning and geography. I enjoyed blending my knowledge across fields, such as applying data analysis to policy and decision-making. After completing my degrees, I enrolled in a post-graduate program that allowed me to work for the government of Illinois, earning enough money to support my travels.By the age of 25, I found myself in an ideal situation: I had good health, a flexible schedule, and a sufficient budget. Even though I could have pursued a higher-paying job, I chose instead to explore the world and continue learning from the “outside.”</p>
<p>On July 18th, 2023, as the sound of the Amtrak horn echoed through Springfield train station, I picked up my bags and embarked on the long-awaited adventure of my life.</p>
<p><strong>Why do I post these story one year later?</strong><br>A: While traveling, my mind was filled with countless stories and new experiences, and I could only capture them by jotting notes on my phone. Now that I’ve built my own blog and returned to the normal rhythm of life, I finally have a place to share these memories and reflect on them. More importantly, this journey reminds me to keep exploring the world, even as I step into new chapters or settle into an “ordinary” life. I will continue working hard and learning from the world, again and again.</p>

<h2 id="🇺🇸-Langsam-beeilen"><a href="#🇺🇸-Langsam-beeilen" class="headerlink" title="🇺🇸 Langsam beeilen"></a>🇺🇸 Langsam beeilen</h2><p>The title is a German slang phrase that means “slowly hurry&#x2F;go.” I learned it from my German friend, Franz, during a volunteering project, and I fell in love with its meaning. People often want to have everything perfectly planned before starting something, but that mindset can slow you down. Nothing is ever truly perfect. “Slowly hurry&#x2F;go” captures the idea of moving forward, even if you’re not fully prepared.</p>
<p>Similarly, my trip wasn’t perfectly planned, but once I hit the road, I knew I had made the right choice. My first stop was Atlanta and then Miami. With over 60 pounds of luggage, I flew from Chicago to Atlanta to visit Uncle Frank, my dad’s former classmate, who lives there. I stayed with him for a week, and we went fishing, worked out, and shot guns—a full “American-style” experience. It was also my first time fishing. The guide used radar and sonar to detect fish, and we managed to catch more than ten weavers. They’re tasty, but a bit tricky to cook. To top it all off, we enjoyed some Chinese food, which I had been missing so much! Time passed quickly, and before I knew it, I was on my way to Miami to catch my next flight.</p>

<p>In Miami, I met up with friends and did some sightseeing. One of my best friends, Cong, flew in from Boston to see me off. She brought along some essentials I would need for my travels. Cong, a lecturer at MIT, is someone I truly admire, and we even discussed some details of writing an academic paper—yes, I managed to do some research while traveling! Another friend, a former classmate, worked for a landscape architecture firm. He vented about his boss and grueling work schedule, often over ten hours a day. It made me realize how international students can sometimes be at a disadvantage in the job market. I also stayed with a British family who were my hosts. The husband was Canadian, and his wife was Cuban, and they had a son named Lin—interestingly, a typical Chinese surname. The hostess explained that she loved Chinese names. When I mentioned that Cuba was my next destination, she was surprised. She made some phone calls to her family in Cuba to check on the current situation, warning me that it wasn’t an ideal time to visit due to the poor economic conditions. Though her concerns made me a bit anxious, I still wanted to see things for myself. So, I gave her my contact information and promised to update her on my travels.</p>
<p>On July 28th, 2023, I left for Cuba, a mysterious country in my “world”.</p>
